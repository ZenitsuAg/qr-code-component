## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

At first, this challenge seemed easy but when I started, I got a little bit stuck, I tried using CSS flexbox, but it wasn't working and also the text p and h1 text had different bg-color, it wasn't the same with the div so I changed the code from;

```css
*{
  background-color:......
}
to
body {
  background-color:.....
}
```
and I got the required effect.
It has been a great learning experience for me and I can't wait to move on to the next project.



### Continued development

I'm going to focus on my CSS, I sometimes tend to forget the property values for a particular effect.
