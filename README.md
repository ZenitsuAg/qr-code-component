## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

At first, this challenge seemed easy but when I started, I got a little bit stuck, I tried using CSS flexbox, but it wasn't working and also the text p and h1 text had different bg-color, it wasn't the same with the div so I changed the code from;

```css
*{
  background-color:......
}
to
body {
  background-color:.....
}
```
and I got the required effect.
It has been a great learning experience for me and I can't wait to move on to the next project.



### Continued development

I'm going to focus on my CSS, I sometimes tend to forget the property values for a particular effect.
